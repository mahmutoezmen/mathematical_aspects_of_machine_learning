1. What is Machine Learning?
2. Statistical Learning
   * Linear classifiers, part 1: The perceptron
   * Supervised learning – Bayesian formulation    
   * Linear classifiers, part 2: Empirical risk minimization 
3. Kernel methods
   * Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
   * Kernel ridge regression
   * Support Vector Machines
   * Nearest neighbor rules
5. Unsupervised learning 
   * Dimension reduction: two popular methods
   * Manifold learning
